# Buzzworthy-Demo-Python
<!-- an old comment -->
<!-- another inline comment -->
This is a working application that can be used to demonstrate how to build, test, deploy and verify a complete CI/CD pipeline using Guide-Rails®

Buzzworthy-Demo-Python is simple web application using Python and Flask.

__Credit:__ This application is shamelessly borrowed and adapted from Rob van der Leek's [cicd-buzz](https://github.com/robvanderleek/cicd-buzz).

__Important:__
 * You do *not* need to know Python to follow this tutorial
 * You will *not* need to setup a local Python environment if you don't want to - you can build, test, deploy and verify the demo application via the Guide-Rails® UI or editing configuration and pushing to your Git repository


## Local Setup (optional)
#### Install Python

   There are a number of online guides for installing and/or upgrading Python on your system at https://www.python.org/. For this tutorial you need Python 2.7 or later

```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
```

#### Install Virtualenv
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

#### Create and activate virtual environment
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies
The tutorial application uses `pytest` for unit testing and `flask` web application framework. Required versions of these dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file.
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run your (unit) tests
```
(venv) $ python -m pytest -v tests/test_generator.py

## Define your CI/CD pipeline in Guide-Rails®
Setting up your pipeline in Guide-Rails® is easy. The following steps assume that you already have a Guide-Rails® account and have completed initial configuration of your subscription with required information for your Company, Organizations, Projects, etc. This tutorial also assumes that you will be using the Guide-Rails® Configuration Console for setting up your pipeline. Alternatively, you can define your pipeline by creating a  configuration file and storing it in `ci/guide-rails.json` in the root directory of your application's source code repository.

#### Onboarding your application Component
The first step is to create a new Component in Guide-Rails which will be associated to your *buzzworthy* application.

From the top navigation bar of the Guide-Rails® Configuration Console, navigate to the Project where your new Component will live, then choose `Create New` from the Component menu:


Second, provide Guide-Rails® with a little information about the application (aka Component) you wish to onboard. In the Guide-Rails® Configuration Console, you will provide the following:



#### Configure your `Build` segment(s)


#### Configure your `Isolation`, `Integration`, `Release` segment(s)


#### Configure your `Production` segment(s)
